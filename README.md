# Socioeconomic Impact of California's Cap-and-Trade Program

This repository contains all the materials for my senior thesis project, which explores the socioeconomic impact of California's cap-and-trade program on household gasoline consumption from 2007 to 2019. The project employs econometric techniques like Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to evaluate the effects, particularly on low-income households, accounting for factors such as gender, education, and household characteristics.
