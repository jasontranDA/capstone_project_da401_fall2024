# Data Dictionary for DA 401 Capstone Project - Fall 2024

This data dictionary provides descriptions of all variables used in the DA 401 Capstone Project. The dataset examines household gasoline expenditures, using a Difference-in-Differences analysis to evaluate the impact of California's cap-and-trade policy.

## Notes on Key Variables
- **`post_tax_period`**: Indicates the implementation of Californiaâ€™s cap-and-trade program. The Difference-in-Differences method relies on this variable to compare the outcomes before and after policy changes.
- **`income_level_poverty`**: Calculated based on household income compared to poverty thresholds. This is used to evaluate the impact of the policy on low-income households.
- **`gasoline_expenditure`**: Primary dependent variable, used to measure the changes in gasoline spending across the observed periods.
- **`gender`** and **`urbrur`**: Interaction terms are included to analyze the heterogeneous effects of gender and urban/rural status on gasoline expenditure.

## Data Cleaning
- Missing values in numeric variables were imputed using mean imputation.
- For binary variables such as `gender`, `urbrur`, and `income_level_poverty`, missing values were imputed through random sampling based on observed proportions.

## Data Quality and Limitations
- The use of mean imputation for missing continuous values may introduce bias if the data is not missing at random.
- The survey covers households only in California, which limits generalizability to other states.
